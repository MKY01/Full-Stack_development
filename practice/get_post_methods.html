<!--
There are only possible methods for forms, either by the GET or POST HTTP request route.

The POST submission
On submit, we send off an HTTP POST request to the route /create with a request body
The request body stringifies the key-value pairs of fields from the form (as part of the name attribute) along with their values.

The GET submission
Sends off a GET request with URL query parameters that appends the form data to the URL.
Ideal for smaller form submissions.
-->


<!--
With a POST method, POST /create:

content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

request body: field1=value1&field2=value2

the URL query parameters can be as long as 2048 characters.
-->

<form action="/create" method="post">
  <div>
    <label for="field">Field 1</label>
    <input type="text" name="field1">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="field">Field 2</label>
    <input type="text" name="field2">
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Create" />
  </div>
</form>

<!--
in comparison...it appends the form data directly to the url, so it is more suitable for shorter form submissions.

With a GET method, GET/create?field1=value1&field2=value2
